# Bootstrap

The Bootstrap component is not intended for use outside of the
SlaxWeb/Framework. It instantiates the application and dispatches the Request
to the defined User Code, with the help of the Router. It also handles loading
of configuration files, hook definitions and Route collections.

As it is not intended to use outside of the Framework, this README does not
cover the usage or installation. But if you find use for the Bootstrap in your
application, feel free to use it!
